## CodeXL

CodeXL is a comprehensive tool suite that enables developers to harness the benefits of CPUs, GPUs and APUs. It includes powerful GPU debugging, comprehensive GPU and CPU profiling, DirectX12® Frame Analysis, static OpenCL™, OpenGL®, Vulkan® and DirectX® kernel/shader analysis capabilities, and APU/CPU/GPU power profiling, enhancing accessibility for software developers to enter the era of heterogeneous computing. CodeXL is available both as a Visual Studio® extension and a standalone user interface application for Windows® and Linux®.

## Motivation

CodeXL, previously a tool developed as closed-source by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., is now released as Open Source. AMD believes that adopting the open-source model and sharing the CodeXL source base with the world can help developers make better use of CodeXL and make CodeXL a better tool.

To encourage 3rd party contribution and adoption, CodeXL is no longer branded as an AMD product. AMD will still continue development of this tool and upload new versions and features to GPUOpen.
